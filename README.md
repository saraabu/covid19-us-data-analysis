# COVID-19 U.S. County-Level Data Analysis Project

This end-to-end project investigates the trends and impacts of COVID-19 across U.S. counties using real-world data from 2020â€“2023. We explore the relationships between pandemic case counts and factors like political turnout, employment levels, household data, and state-level responses.

##  Key Objectives
- Clean, merge, and explore COVID-19 datasets
- Compare case trends with presidential election voting data
- Analyze case spikes using regression models and RMSE evaluation
- Test hypotheses using t-tests and chi-square statistics
- Forecast county-level COVID trends using polynomial models
- Build an interactive dashboard (final stage)

##  Datasets Used
- COVID-19 Cases & Deaths: [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org)
- U.S. 2020 Presidential Election: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/us-election-2020)
- U.S. Census ACS Data: [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/)
- Employment Data: [BLS CEW](https://data.bls.gov)

##  Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Dash for dashboard building

##  My Contributions (Sara Abukhalaf)
- Led Stage 1 & 3 with a focus on New York
- Modeled COVID case growth using polynomial regression
- Conducted hypothesis testing (presidential vote turnout vs. case rate)
- Helped with data cleaning and merging
- Dashboard implementation for trend exploration
