# COVID-19 U.S. County-Level Data Analysis Project

This end-to-end project investigates the trends and impacts of COVID-19 across U.S. counties using real-world data from 2020â€“2023. We explore the relationships between pandemic case counts and factors like political turnout, employment levels, household data, and state-level responses.

##  Key Objectives
- Clean, merge, and explore COVID-19 datasets
- Compare case trends with presidential election voting data
- Analyze case spikes using regression models and RMSE evaluation
- Test hypotheses using t-tests and chi-square statistics
- Forecast county-level COVID trends using polynomial models
- Build an interactive dashboard (final stage)

##  Data Sources

- [COVID-19 Case & Death Data (USAFacts)](https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/)
- [2020 U.S. Presidential Election Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/us-election-2020)
- [Census Demographic & Housing Data (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP1Y2018.DP05?q=dp)
- [COVID-19 Case Trends Worldwide (Our World in Data)](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)

##  Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook (Python 3)
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, plotly
- Dash (for interactive dashboard)
- Scikit-learn (regression modeling)


##  My Contributions (Sara Abukhalaf)
- Led Stage 1 & 3 with a focus on New York
- Modeled COVID case growth using polynomial regression
- Conducted hypothesis testing (presidential vote turnout vs. case rate)
- Helped with data cleaning and merging
- Dashboard implementation for trend exploration
